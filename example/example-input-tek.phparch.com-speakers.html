                <h5>PHP 7 is (Almost) Here. OMG! PANIC!</h5>
                If all goes well, PHP 7 will be released late this year. Given that PHP 5.6 will be completely end of lifed less than two years later, there&#039;s going to be a relatively narrow window for migrating from PHP 5 to PHP 7. This migration may include dealing with backward compatibility breaks, but don&#039;t panic! In this session, I&#039;ll talk about what&#039;s changing, what&#039;s not changing, and how to deal with these changes both in terms of performing a one-way migration and keeping code compatible with both PHP 5 and 7.<br />

                Whether you work with it daily, infrequently, or never, Magento 1 has been the ascendant PHP eCommerce platform for five years. The Magento 2 era is now upon us, featuring an updated architecture with full, configurable DI, aspect-oriented programming, and a truly decoupled, Composer-based system of modules that allows Magento components to be integrated into PHP app environments. This talk looks at some of the improvements and remaining challenges facing Magento 2.x on its way to a GA release and informs participants on how to get involved with the development and documentation on GitHub.<br />

                <h5>A Toolbox for APIs and Integrations</h5>
                Modern web applications do more than display data from a database. They talk to all kinds of services, bringing together data from a variety of sources and combining it in new and meaningful ways. This is the age of APIs and integrations! Whether internal or external, we often find ourselves building or integrating with APIs. There are many tools to help, but it&#039;s difficult to know which tools are best. In this talk, we&#039;ll narrow the field to take a look at a few useful tools for building, consuming, debugging, and testing APIs and integrations.<br />

                <h5>HTTP is Dead. Long Live HTTP/2!</h5>
                Request for Comments (RFC) 2616 reigned supreme as the specification for the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) for fifteen years. Now, it&#039;s been obsoleted by a handful of new RFCs, and HTTP 2.0 is on the horizon. In this talk, we&#039;ll take a look at the new RFCs, discuss the differences and clarifications they make, and take a look ahead at what&#039;s new in HTTP 2.0 and what it means for you.<br />

                <h5>Building Offline-Enabled Apps with PouchDB</h5>
                Mobile web apps shouldn&#039;t stop working when there&#039;s no network connection. Offline-enabled apps built using PouchDB can provide a better, faster user experience while potentially reducing battery and bandwidth usage. Based on the Apache CouchDB database, PouchDB is an open-source syncing JavaScript database that runs within a web browser. Learn how to use the HTML5 Offline Application Cache, PouchDB, CouchDB, and Cordova/PhoneGap to develop fully-featured and cross-platform native apps, responsive mobile web apps, or high-fidelity prototypes that work just as well offline as they do online.<br />

                <h5>OOP is More Than Cars and Dogs</h5>
                When developers are introduced to object-oriented programming, one of the first things they are taught is that nouns turn into objects, verbs into methods, and Dog is a subclass of Animal. OOP is more than just turning things into classes and objects and showing that both Boats and Cars have motors, and that Dogs and Cats both speak(). Let&#039;s look at OOP in real-world settings and go beyond cars and dogs to see how to use object-oriented programming properly in PHP. Traits, composition, inheritance – none of it is off limits!<br />

This talk explains the choices, considerations, and issues we ran into while developing the driver to work with multiple engines, and our first steps supporting Facebook&#039;s HHVM.<br />

Engineers who abandoned the platform years ago will see everything they&#039;ve missed since then and can objectively evaluate if it&#039;s time to rejoin the &gt; 23% of the Internet already using WordPress.<br />

                The best way to fix bugs in your code is to first write a script that reproduces the bug, then refactor your code so that the bug disappears. This is the essence of unit testing. Attendees will walk through a pre-built PHP application with a handful of reported bugs - broken features, security vulnerabilities, and performance bottlenecks. They&#039;ll see first-hand how to write code to test the bug in isolation from the greater application. Then they&#039;ll learn strategies for refactoring the application to fix the issue.<br />

See how your tests can slip in unobtrusively to take over your codebase from the inside, eating away at the spaghetti and creating a solid platform for future development.<br />

                <h5>Navigating Your Git Repository</h5>
                You can git pull, merge, and even force-push with the best of them, but what&#039;s really going on in that .git folder? What&#039;s a commit, and how does it know where it came from? What does checking out a tag have to do with detaching your head, and why does rebase mess things up so thoroughly? In this talk, we&#039;ll get inside individual commits and learn to push them around, then zoom out to the whole repository. Come find out how Git&#039;s glorified game of Connect-the-Dots can improve the development workflow and collaboration opportunities for your whole team!<br />

                <h5>Ditching jQuery</h5>
                JQuery is awesome, but with all major browsers following the ES and HTML5 specs, the library has become more of a convenience than a necessity for browser compatibility. While the library is useful and ubiquitous, it does distract us from learning the language that it&#039;s built on. This talk will outline functionalities that pure javascript provides, and also provide steps we can take to begin writing vanilla javascript applications and start appreciating the power and uniqueness of javascript.<br />

                <h5>Introduction to Design Patterns in PHP</h5>
                Design patterns are really helpful to make code easy to extend, maintain and unit tests. That&#039;s also why they&#039;re used in many modern web frameworks in order to make them fully flexible. However, learning and understanding design patterns is often not an easy task because it&#039;s usually difficult to find real world examples of implementation. In this 3 hour tutorial, you will discover some most useful design patterns in action with real world practical examples.<br />

                <h5>Dependency Injection, Dependency Inversion, and You</h5>
                As developers we&#039;re told to limit the coupling of our code for testability and reusability. Taking the time to understand exactly what dependency injection is and how to apply it in PHP projects is important. In this talk we will take a look at both dependency injection and dependency inversion from a theoretical and practical standpoint. Walking out of the room you should understand the motivation for practicing dependency injection as well as how the Dependency Inversion Principle can make your code more SOLID.<br />

                <h5>Fundamental Object-Oriented PHP</h5>
                PHP as a language supports several programming paradigms including procedural, object-oriented, and, to some extent, functional programming. In this tutorial we will talk about the fundamentals of object-oriented design and how we can apply then using PHP. Specifically, we will cover the power of interfaces, the differences between inheritance and composition, dependency injection and inversion, and the idea of the SOLID principles. Regardless of your experience with PHP and OOP you should walk out of this tutorial with a better understanding of how to apply these ideas to your projects.<br />

                This full-day workshop will explore MongoDB at depth. After a crash course in non-relational database concepts, attendees will learn all of the MongoDB essentials, from its flexible storage model and query API to advanced topics such as schema design, data aggregation, and indexing. Beyond single-node deployments, we&#039;ll investigate how MongoDB can achieve fault-tolerance and scalability with replica sets and sharding, respectively, and how to effectively support those deployments in a production application.

                <h5>The Dark Art of Debugging</h5>
                Don&#039;t assume anything. Being able to replicate, isolate, and fix bugs in software requires methodical logic, creative problem solving, curiosity, and a never-ending quest for understanding. Bugs are an inevitable part of the software development process. But they can also be extremely elusive: there&#039;s a space between zero and one, between the way the machine counts and thinks and the way we count and think. When you search for bugs in software and its stubborn resistance to human desires, that space is where you&#039;ll find them. This talk is about the skills (and some of the tools) used to debug.<br />

                We all do our best work when we&#039;re excited, motivated, and focused, when we&#039;re free of blockers like unanswered questions, and free of distractions like meetings. This presentation will be useful for both developers and the people who work with them. It will empower developers to identify and communicate things that just don&#039;t feel right in ways that enable managers to better support them; and it will give project managers insight on the behaviors they should be on the lookout for, what those behaviors might possibly mean, and what they can do to facilitate developers kicking ass.<br />

                <h5>Enough about Classes, Let&#039;s Talk Templates</h5>
                We talk a lot about writing highly decoupled, dependency injectable, single responsibility classes and methods. And this stuff is ALL GOOD. But, are we thinking enough about what defines quality templates? How seriously are you taking security when writing your templates? How tightly are these templates coupled to the objects they use? This talk will show you how to write awesome, modern-day PHP templates. We&#039;ll look at new features you should be using, how to decouple templates from your business logic, where to best place your presentation logic, and more.<br />

                <h5>Rethink Image Manipulations with Glide</h5>
                Almost all apps require some form of image cropping or resizing. This is often done with background jobs, using tools like GD and ImageMagick. This talk will introduce you to a new technique that uses a recent addition to The PHP League called Glide. Glide is a wonderfully easy-touse on-demand image manipulation library with an HTTP-based API. I&#039;ll explain in a little more detail what it is, how it works, and how to set it up!<br />

                <h5>Composer Best Practices</h5>
                Composer has grown into the de-facto standard PHP dependency manager. While we struggle to make it easy to use, mastering dependency management and packaging in general remains tricky. In this session you will learn how to leverage Composer version constraints and grasp stabilities and semantic versioning, along with a few more tips on being a good OSS citizen. You should already be comfortable with Composer basics and eager to learn about it some more.<br />

                I often see developers (especially self-taught developers) trying to &quot;reinvent the wheel&quot; because they are not familiar with some key computer science concepts. In this talk, I&#039;ll give you the Cliffs notes version of a CS degree, focusing primarily on the highly relevant and immediately usable principles. Sample topics include: object-oriented design, graph theory, state diagrams, regular expressions, and complexity theory. To get the most out of this talk, you should have a good working knowledge of PHP, but no formal computer science education is required.<br />

Learn the nuts and bolts of payment processing on the web and walk away with a plethora of resources to use on your next eCommerce or payment processing project. I&#039;ll discuss what actually happens behind the scenes as a card is processed and outline best practices – both technical and operational – for achieving a secure, compliant, and robust processing environment.<br />

                PHPSpec and Behat are two amazing PHP tools that empower specification-driven development and behavior-driven development. These two tools combined can help you build test coverage, but many people don&#039;t realize they can also write much of your code for you. In this talk, we&#039;ll see what PHPSpec and Behat can do, through a series of examples and use cases. In other words, I heard you like to code, so I wrote code that writes code while you code.<br />

                NoSQL databases are everywhere and they&#039;re here to stay. For a successful scalable web application, it is vital to understand the capabilities of NoSQL databases. Relational databases are not dead, either, and they will not be. Understanding the abilities of each will help you to make better architectural decisions. Hybrid database solutions could use the best of the two worlds. In this talk, we will delve  into the important decision making factors for each. As an example, we will study an online game at Ubisoft Montreal that switched from a SQL database to a polyglot persistence with no data loss and no downtime.<br />

                Oh Noes! A templating engine! But why? Twig helps you easily manipulate template data while subtly encouraging you to handle all non-trivial logic elsewhere. It&#039;s also super easy to start using productively. There will be plenty of super simple examples, so with only a basic understanding of HTML/CSS you&#039;ll be able to immediately get started creating your own data rich templates using Twig.<br />

                <h5>Data Structures in PHP</h5>
                Some problem classes require specialized data structures to optimize runtime or memory usage. This session will cover more recent additions to the core Standard PHP Library extension from PHP 5.3, as well as several libraries in the wild that offer additional data structures. No computer science background is necessary; this tutorial will present data structures in understandable terms with practical examples.<br />

                <h5>Mocking Dependencies in Unit Tests with Phake</h5>
                Reports of the death of TDD have been greatly exaggerated. All but the most trivial of applications make use of the OOP principle of composition and as such require mocking of dependencies in unit tests. While PHPUnit has become the de facto unit testing framework for many projects, its mocking API leaves something to be desired. This presentation is an introduction to Phake, an alternative mocking library with a more concise and intuitive API and a more substantial feature set that removes the headaches from mocking.<br />

                <h5>PHP and Standards</h5>
                The PHP FIG is a group established in 2010 with the aim of putting together a set of best practices for PHP apps to follow. Four PSRs have been accepted and a few proposals are currently under discussion. These PSRs are designed to make it easier for people to build packages that work with each other by providing interfaces that they can implement without enforcing an implementation. This talk will cover the existing PSRs and the ones that are under consideration, and will then take a brief look at the de facto standards that people use to fulfil the requirements of each PSR<br />

It was for me too before I started using Vagrant and Ansible. Vagrant is a tool for automating the creation of virtual machines. Of course, that&#039;s only half of the battle - once you have a machine you need to configure it. That&#039;s where Ansible comes in. By the end of this tutorial, everyone will have created a Vagrant box that installs PHP, Apache2 and configured an example website.<br />

                Traditional relational databases — ironically — are not that good at the complex relationships some modern applications need. Multiple joins and complex sub-queries can gradually take a toll on performance. Graph Databases, on the other hand, are all about relationships. In this talk we will look at using the popular Neo4j graph database with PHP to build efficient relational data for OmNomHub: not your average recipe site.<br />

We strive to achieve the laser focus of &quot;the zone,&quot; and turn to music as an aid, but isn&#039;t music just another distraction for our already taxed attention spans? I&#039;ll discuss how meditation and mindfulness can help with focusing, without the need for external stimuli or the requirement of total silence. I&#039;ll also discuss how my productivity has increased, and how my stress levels have decreased, thanks to Etsy&#039;s &quot;Breathing Room,&quot; a place where we&#039;re encouraged to practice yoga and meditate.<br />

I&#039;ll discuss how in a short time I grew from a junior programmer who knew nothing about software testing into an engineer who is sought after for help with testing. I&#039;ve tutored a new hire who couldn&#039;t help but shout out loud &quot;Wow, testing is so cool!&quot; I&#039;ll provide tips and examples of how it works at Etsy, so that you can create a testing culture of your own.<br />

                <h5>Drinking from the Firehose: Real-time Metrics</h5>
                To understand an application&#039;s performance, you have to know what to measure. That&#039;s the easy part. How do you take those measurements? And then get them to the people who need them? Well, that&#039;s where things get complicated! Let&#039;s explore the lessons learned by engineers at one of the world&#039;s top web companies in their quest to find meaning at 5 MB/s. We&#039;ll discuss the tools and techniques that enable the collection, indexing, and analysis of billions or more datapoints each hour, and learn how these same approaches can empower your applications and your business, no matter the scale.<br />

                <h5>TDD: Team-Driven Development</h5>
                Developing software as part of a team introduces a host of challenges. A motivated team working together can marshal the strengths of each of its members to create something larger than the sum of its parts. Teams that don’t work together can falter and make the workplace miserable. Strong teams need strong leaders, and leadership is something that can be cultivated. No matter your job title, if you are part of a team, you can be a leader. We’ll discuss strategies for dealing with conflict, how to be a stronger communicator, and how you can help your team be its absolute best.<br />

                The analysis of code coverage is a feature that is extended and improved with each release of PHPUnit. In this session we will cover all aspects of PHPUnit&#039;s code coverage functionality in depth. You will learn how to leverage this important functionality more effectively to augment and guide your testing efforts.<br />

                The goal of all tests is to discover problems as early as possible. Depending on the context, the same test can be used to answer different questions about the quality of the software under test. Using the three dimensions of goal, scope, and notation is one approach to categorize tests. Attendees of this session will learn which aspects of an application should be tested and how to efficiently implement these tests so that they are easy to write and fast to execute while delivering highly reliable results.<br />

                <h5>Building PHP Daemons and Long Running Processes</h5>
                There are things you don&#039;t want to, or can&#039;t do, inside a web request. It could be a task that needs to be retired if it fails, maybe one that takes a significantly long time to process, or multiple jobs that need to be processed over time. Whether you&#039;re sending an email, processing a video, or consuming Twitter&#039;s streaming API, you should be using a separate process, and probably a daemon. Learn how to stop abusing cron, and easily daemonize a PHP script that responds responsibly to process signals.<br />

In this session, we will explore APIs you may have never considered by building an application using as many APIs as possible. You will leave with a new knowledge and appreciation of how to use the right APIs for whatever application you&#039;re building and save time and effort on redundant tasks.<br />

                From ReactPHP to Facebook Hack&#039;s Async implementation and many more, asynchronous programming has been a hot topic lately. But how well does async programming support work in PHP and what can you actually use it for in your projects? Let&#039;s look at some real-world use cases and how they leverage the power of async to do things you didn&#039;t know PHP could do.<br />

                <h5>When Dynamic Becomes Static: The Next Step in Web Caching</h5>
                When your site gets swamped by a huge amount of visitors, tools like Varnish can improve scalability for static sites. But when user-specific content is needed, a hit to the backend web server is still needed, causing scalability issues. We&#039;ll look at a new Nginx module that implements a fast and scalable solution to this problem, changing the way developers think about designing sites with user-specific content, and changing the way data is (pre)processed for dynamic websites.<br />

                You’ve been programming for a while now. You’re beginning to feel that you’ve got a handle on things but at the same time can’t escape the feeling that you’ve somehow plateaued in your growth as a software developer. In this talk Yitzchok, a rabbinic scholar and software developer, shares the “wisdom of the sages” as practical, actionable advice – strategies and tactics – that you can use to reinvigorate your growth as a software developer.<br />

                As software developers we tend to practice our craft as doctors &amp; lawyers rather than as athletes &amp; musicians, failing to recognize the impact the tradeoffs and half measures dictated by many projects have on our growth as craftspeople. Code katas - deliberate practice, free of the pressures of &quot;getting things done&quot; - are an excellent way to strengthen our mental &quot;muscle memory&quot; and grow our craft. In this workshop, we will examine the case for regular, deliberate practice and engage in guided, collaborative, hands-on learning designed to allow you to integrate code katas into your training.<br />

Zeev Suraski is one of the principal authors of the PHP programming
language.  Zeev&#039;s involvement with PHP dates back to 1997, when he and Andi
Gutmans created the foundation for PHP 3 - the first &#039;modern&#039; version of PHP
that actually still resembles PHP 5.6 and even 7.0.  Zeev later spearheaded
the PHP 4 project - which made PHP the most popular development language in
the world for creating Web applications, and contributed to PHP 5.  Zeev is
probably the person with the most blame for the eternal absence of PHP 6,
having campaigned heavily to call the next generation of PHP as &#039;PHP 7&#039;
(which, incidentally, was Andi&#039;s idea).  Zeev co-founded Zend Technologies
in 1999, serves as its CTO and leads the company&#039;s research and development
teams. Most recently, he helped create the Z-Ray developer productivity
technology, and developed the Symfony plugin for Z-Ray.  Zeev holds a
Bachelor&#039;s degree in Computer Science from the Technion, Israel Institute of
Technology.</dd>

                <h5>The PHP 7 Story</h5>
                
PHP 7 is right around the corner, with the development team aiming to
release it before the end of 2015.  With the previous major release of PHP
having happened more than a decade ago, this is a very exciting milestone in
PHP&#039;s history, that promises to bring both far-reaching performance boosts
for real world workloads and a host of new features.  In the keynote, Zeev
will share the evolution of PHP&#039;s major versions, the behind-the-scenes
story of how PHP 7 came to be and its key benefits and features.<br />
